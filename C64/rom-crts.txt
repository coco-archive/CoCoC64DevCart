********** SuperGames cartridge *************

The SuperGames cartridge is one of the few Commodore
brand cartridges that uses standard 27x64, 27x128 or 27x256
type EPROMS.  In addition, there is a 4bit control port (74175) at 
$DF00-DFFF which controls which of the 16kb bank is active. Chip
U1 appears at address $8000-9FFF (ROML is /CS), U2 at $A000-BFFF
(ROMH is /CS). On reset both GAME/EXROM are pulled low forcing the
16kb external ROM memory map. This can be changed by splitting the
GAME/EXROM pins so that only EXROM is active or swapping signal
from the 74175 chip to active high rather than low. Auto-boot can
be included in the start bytes of bank 0. The bit definitions of
the $DF00 control port are as follows:

	Bits 0 & 1 define bank selection 0-3, bank 0 is power-on default
        Bit 2 is GAME/EXROM control, setting gives RAM/BASIC back
        Bit 3 is like a write-protect, preventing further writes to the
        latch.

Simple hacks may be to re-wire Bit3 as A15 and use 27x512
chips; or to re-wire and provide independent control of GAME and EXROM.





********** MagicDesk I cartridge *************

This cartridge features all pins on the edge connector, and can be configured 
for up to four EPROMs. Typically these EPROMs are only 8k types, but the cart
could be hacked for the higher capacity types. By default, the images appear in
the ROML region ($8000-9FFF) though again, this can be changes with a wire or two.

Two bits in the control register define which of the four ROMs is banked in. 
The control port is at $DE00-DEFF. Only D0 and D1 are connected by default. 
	00 selects ROM-A 
	01 selects ROM-B 
	10 selects ROM-C 
	11 selects ROM-D

J1 and J3 shorted allows 2364 ROMs
J2 and J4 shorted allows 27xxx ROMs

The capability of this cartridge is under-rated. It is conceivable to turn it into 
a 128k ROM pack with just a few wiring and jumper modifications.
